# ZenSpend - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### 3. Chat Companion Ready

The Chat reflection companion works immediately - no setup needed!

The DeepSeek API key is stored internally in `.env` and handled by the app. Users never see or enter any API keys.

## 🎨 First Experience

When you first open ZenSpend:

1. **Check in** with how you're feeling today (Home tab)
2. **Try the breathing exercise** - 45 seconds of calm
3. **Add an expense** to see the financial weather
4. **Practice pausing** before your next purchase (Pause tab)
5. **Reflect with the AI companion** about your money feelings (Chat tab)

## 🏗️ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized app will be in the `dist/` folder.

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 💡 Tips

- **Mobile-first**: Open your browser's dev tools and switch to mobile view for the best experience
- **Swipe gestures**: Navigate between pages by swiping left/right (on mobile or trackpad)
- **No backend needed**: Everything is saved in your browser's localStorage
- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your device (except Chat messages sent to DeepSeek)

## 🎯 Navigation

Use the bottom navigation bar:

- **◯ Home** - Daily check-in and financial weather
- **◐ Expenses** - Track what you've spent
- **◉ Pause** - Reflect before buying
- **◑ Insights** - Journal-like observations
- **◔ Chat** - AI reflection companion

## 🧘 Philosophy

Remember: ZenSpend is not about being "good" or "bad" with money. It's about creating awareness and reducing stress.

There's no rush. Take your time.
